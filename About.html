            <h1>Head of School’s Welcome</h1>
            <h4>Professor Denise Ferris</h4>
            <h4>Head of School of Art & Design</h4>

        <p>The 2018 Graduating Exhibition celebrates 40 years of rich history at the school, which continues to play a central role in the cultural life of Canberra as the ANU School of Art
                & Design. The catalogue recounts this year’s impressive exhibition of work by students in undergraduate and postgraduate coursework degrees. The work on exhibition is the culmination of diverse art practice, and studies in art history and art theory as well as design.
                
                Art History and Art Theory, and Design together with the school’s Visual Art disciplines — Printmedia, Sculpture, Textiles, Ceramics, Furniture, Glass, Gold and Silversmithing, Painting, Photography, Animation and Video — offer deep and cross-disciplinary learning opportunities. Domestic and international field trips, in-country intensives, environment and indigenous studies, internships at major arts and cultural institutions, international student exchanges and artist residencies in schools offer a rich outward-looking student experience. Excellence in education is driven by the high quality research and practice of our staff. A dynamic visitor’s program of international and interstate artists and scholars gives additional perspectives to students who have access to an exciting program in the school’s gallery spaces.
                
                We extend gratitude to our patrons in the Emerging Artists Support Scheme (EASS). EASS continues to give our graduates sponsorship in a transitional time when support can be crucial. The ANU Foundation for the Visual Arts funds an entry-level scholarship for one student and supports the school to host visiting artists. The Foundation has also funded administrative assistance for managing the growing EASS portfolio. We appreciate the guidance of EASS coordinator Dr Waratah Lahy.
                
                The ANU School of Art & Design staff congratulate our graduates on their achievements. We invite them to remain an active part of the school and the ANU through our national and international alumni networks. We wish the 2017 graduates every success for their future contributions especially those they make to the cultural sector, which
                is essential to a vigorous and forward-thinking Australian society.
